# Forking
Forking is the process of contributing or using  a public repository or private permitted repository.Fork is nothing but a copy of repository, which helps us to use others project repositories which we find helpful for our project.We can use the files of that project by simply forking them and making modifications to it with out affecting the project that is original.
This process is similar to copying a folder from one drive to another drive.Let us see how to fork a repository.
  a) First you have to login to your github account( provided you have one or else create your github account).
  b) You have to find the author of the repo by finding his/her name (or you can use author name+name of the repo )in the search box in the top left corner.Press ALLGITHUB          after entering the name to search.You will find some relevant matches, choose the one you want to.
  c) Selected repo will be opened , then click fork button in the top right of the screen, so that the repo can be forked and you can see it under your repos.
  d) You can also delete the forked repository, if you think that it is of no use further.
  e) You can delete the same repository that you forked above. For this, go to the repository page from which you forked in the last step. You can navigate to the                    repository page from the repository list located in the left column of the dashboard.
     i)On the repository page, go to Settings located on the top row.
     ii)On the settings page, scroll down to the bottom of the page and a section called Danger Zone will appear.
     iii)Press Delete this repository in that section.
     iv)Disclaimer will popup on the screen asking you to rewrite the repository name. Write the repository name that you used and press I understand the consequences, delete           this repository button.
     v)This will successfully delete the repository.
